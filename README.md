# Star Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVC)

The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of 4 kernel functions, namely "rbf", "linear", "polynomial" and "sigmoid" in SVC (Support Vector Classification), the classification function of SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm, on a multiple classification application with star data set.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from this [link](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Stars.csv). It contains various features of stars.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

# Project Steps
1. Importing and Analyzing the Dataset
2. Converting Categorical Data to Numerical Data
3. Splitting the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
4. Scaling the Data
5. Building and Evaluating Models with Support Vector Machines (SVC)
   - Rbf (Radial Basis Function) Kernel Function
   - Linear Kernel Function
   - Polynomial Kernel Function
   - Sigmoid Kernel Function

# Results and Comparison
Models created using various kernel functions are evaluated and compared based on their accuracy scores.

# Conclusion
The project demonstrates the classification of stars using Support Vector Machines with different kernel functions, highlighting the importance of choosing the right kernel function for optimal performance.
